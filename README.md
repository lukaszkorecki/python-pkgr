Tested on Ubuntu 14.04

First of all you'll need extra ssl packages for python compilation & running the
app.

```
sudo apt-get install -y libssl1.0.0 libssl0.9.8 libreadline5
```

#TODO

At the moment when building the package everything gets dumped into
`/opt/py-pkgr` (the vritualenv/project name) - I'll fix this :-)
